## Brand Family

Shikkimoji lives within the Shikki brand family:

| Product | Role |
|---------|------|
| **Shikki** | BUILD — the CLI orchestrator |
| **Kintsugi** | DESIGN — the design system |
| **WabiSabi** | PRESENT — the iOS app |
| **Moto** | AUTHENTICATE — auth layer |
| **Shikkimoji** | COMMUNICATE — the emoji language |

## Phase 1: Team Brainstorm

### @Hanami (UX) — 3 Ideas

**1. Emoji as Muscle Memory, Not Novelty**
Emoji commands must feel like keyboard shortcuts, not gimmicks. The mapping should be *associative* — the emoji instantly evokes the action. A carrot (🥕) for doctor works because of the classic Bugs Bunny "What's up, doc?" — playful, questioning, and instantly memorable. If a user has to think "wait, what was the thermometer one again?", the protocol fails. Every emoji must pass the **3-second recall test**: can you remember what it does after seeing it once?

**2. Text Always Works**
Emoji are an *acceleration layer*, never a gate. Every emoji command MUST have a text equivalent that works identically. The help output (`shikki help` or 📃) should show both side by side. Tab-completion in the shell should suggest emoji after the text command, and vice versa. Non-emoji users lose nothing. Emoji users gain speed and joy.

**3. Discoverability via the Splash Screen**
On startup, Shikki's splash/welcome screen should show the 5 most-used emoji commands for the current user (learned from signal history). New users see the "starter kit" (🥕 🌡️ 📊 🚀 📃). The `shikki menu` TUI should have an emoji cheat sheet panel toggled with `?`. Emoji should also appear in tmux status bar segments — clicking the thermometer segment runs `shikki status`.

---

### @Sensei (Architecture) — 2 Ideas

**1. EmojiRouter as Pre-Parser — Dual Strategy**
Swift ArgumentParser does not natively support emoji as subcommand names (they work in `commandName` strings but are fragile across terminals). The strategy is two-pronged:

**Now: EmojiRouter SPM package** — implement `EmojiRouter` as a standalone SPM package that intercepts `CommandLine.arguments` in `ShikkiCommand.main()` *before* `parseAsRoot()`. The router maps emoji to their text equivalents, rewrites argv, and lets ArgumentParser handle the rest. This keeps ArgumentParser clean and makes emoji a zero-cost layer. Ship this immediately.

**Later: Fork ArgumentParser** — nobody has submitted native emoji subcommand support to Apple's `swift-argument-parser` yet. This is an opportunity. After `EmojiRouter` proves the concept in production, contribute a PR to apple/swift-argument-parser adding first-class emoji command support. We'd be the first to do this.

```swift
// In ShikkiCommand.main(), before parseAsRoot():
let rewritten = EmojiRouter.rewrite(CommandLine.arguments)
// Then parse using rewritten args
```

The `EmojiRouter` is a simple `[String: String]` dictionary with one twist: some emoji carry arguments (e.g., `🧠 "design a caching layer"`), so the router must handle `emoji + rest-of-args` patterns. Emoji that map to commands with arguments pass the remainder through.

**2. Bidirectional Rendering**
Commands that produce output should render emoji in their output too. `shikki status` shows `🌡️ Status` as header. `shikki doctor` shows `🥕 Diagnostics`. This creates visual consistency — the emoji you type is the emoji you see. The `EmojiRegistry` should be the single source of truth for both parsing and rendering, stored in ShikkiKit so both CLI and TUI can use it.

---

### @Shogun (Market) — 2 Ideas

**1. First-Mover in Emoji CLI**
No mainstream CLI tool uses emoji as first-class commands. GitHub CLI (`gh`), Homebrew, npm, cargo — all text-only. Some tools use emoji in *output* (Homebrew's beer mug, cargo's crab), but none accept emoji as *input commands*. Shikki would be the first production CLI where `🚀` actually does something. This is a genuine differentiator. It's the kind of thing that goes viral on dev Twitter/Bluesky — "wait, you can just type a rocket emoji and it deploys?"

**2. Shareability and Word-of-Mouth**
Emoji commands are inherently shareable. A screenshot of `shikki 🚀` deploying code is more memorable than `shikki wave --resume`. This feeds organic discovery. The emoji protocol should be mentioned prominently in the README, with a GIF showing the flow. For conference talks: "Here's our entire deploy workflow" *types rocket emoji* — crowd goes wild.

---

### @Enso (Brand) — 2 Ideas

**1. Emoji as Shikki's Emotional Vocabulary**
Shikki is not a cold tool — it's a professional companion. The emoji protocol makes that tangible. Each emoji is a *word* in Shikki's language. The carrot says "let me check on you" (Bugs Bunny style — "What's up, doc?"). The brain says "let's think together." The rocket says "let's go." This isn't decoration — it's the product's personality expressed through interaction design. The protocol should feel like a conversation shorthand between you and your tool.

**2. The Soul Emojis**
Every brand has core symbols. Shikki's soul emojis are:
- 🥕 — Health (the diagnostic carrot, Bugs Bunny energy — playful and distinctive)
- 🧠 — Intelligence (the team brain, collective thinking)
- 🚀 — Momentum (shipping, executing, moving forward)
- 🌟 — Excellence (the challenge star, pushing quality higher)

These four should appear in the logo, documentation, and splash screen. They ARE Shikki.

## Phase 2: Complete Emoji Registry

### Core Registry (@Daimyo's Map)

| Emoji | Command | Args | Description |
|-------|---------|------|-------------|

| 🐰🥕 | `doctor` | — | Doctor alias (Bugs Bunny with carrot) |
| 🥕🐰 | `doctor` | — | Doctor alias (carrot + rabbit variant) |
| 🧠 | `brain` | `<prompt>` | Brainstorm with @t team |
| 🌟 | `challenge` | `<prompt>` | Challenge session with @t team (Easter egg!) |
| 🚀 | `wave` | `[--resume]` | Run next waves/tasks |
| 🤠 | `ingest` | `<prompt>` | Ingest or remember with @Indy |
| 🤔 | `explain` | `<UUID\|prompt>` | Tell me more about that |

### Additional Commands (Team Proposals)

These are daily actions missing from the original map:

| Emoji | Command | Args | Description | Rationale |
|-------|---------|------|-------------|-----------|
| 📦 | `ship` | `[--why "reason"]` | Quality-gated release pipeline | Shipping is a daily action. Package = ready to deliver. |
| ✏️ | `spec` | `<input>` | Generate feature specification | The pencil writes the spec — first stone of Shikki Flow. |
| ⏸️ | `pause` | `<slug>` | Pause a company/session | Universal pause symbol. |
| ▶️ | `restart` | — | Restart/resume session | Universal play symbol. |
| 💾 | `context save` | — | Save context/checkpoint | Floppy disk = save. Universal across generations. |
| 📂 | `context load` | `[id]` | Load/restore context | Folder open = load. |
| 🔄 | `history` | — | Show session/command history | Circular arrows = look back. |
| 🗡️ | `review` | `<PR#>` | @Ronin adversarial review | Katana/sword = @Ronin's weapon. Slices through bad code. |
| 🏗️ | `decide` | `<prompt>` | @Sensei architecture decision | Construction = structural decisions. |
| 🔇 | `focus` | `[duration]` | Focus mode — suppress notifications, queue inbox | Mute = deep work. No interruptions. |
| ⏪ | `undo` | `[UUID]` | Rollback last action/checkpoint | Rewind = undo. |
| 📋 | `backlog` | — | Show backlog | Clipboard = task list. |
| 🔔 | `wake` | — | Wake/ping agents | Bell = wake up. |
| 📝 | `log` | `<message>` | Quick log entry | Notepad = write it down. |
| 🎯 | `codir` | `<prompt>` | Co-direction session | Target = focused direction. |

## Phase 3: Feature Brief

### What
An emoji-first command interface for Shikki that maps single emoji (or emoji + arguments) to full CLI commands. Emoji are parsed before ArgumentParser sees them, rewritten to text equivalents, and executed normally. The system is bidirectional: emoji appear in command output too. Named **Shikkimoji** (漆器文字) — the emoji language of Shikki.

### Why
1. **Speed** — One emoji is faster than typing a multi-character command
2. **Expressiveness** — Emoji convey intent and emotion that text commands cannot
3. **Personality** — Makes Shikki feel alive, not like another cold CLI tool
4. **Shareability** — Screenshots of emoji commands are inherently viral
5. **Competitive moat** — No other CLI tool does this. First-mover advantage.

### Who
- Primary: @Daimyo (power user who types 100+ commands/day)
- Secondary: Any Shikki user who wants faster interaction
- Tertiary: People who see Shikki demos and think "I want that"

### Where
- `ShikkiKit/Services/EmojiRouter.swift` — emoji-to-command mapping + argv rewriting
- `ShikkiKit/Services/EmojiRegistry.swift` — single source of truth for all emoji mappings
- `ShikkiCommand.main()` — integration point (before parseAsRoot)
- `TypoCorrector.swift` — extend to handle near-miss emoji (e.g., wrong clock variant)

---

## Phase 4: Business Rules

### BR-EM-01: EmojiRouter Pre-Parser
The `EmojiRouter` intercepts `CommandLine.arguments` before ArgumentParser parsing. It rewrites the first argument if it matches a registered emoji. Remaining arguments pass through unchanged.

### BR-EM-02: EmojiRegistry as Single Source of Truth
All emoji-to-command mappings live in `EmojiRegistry`, a static dictionary in ShikkiKit. Both the CLI (for parsing) and renderers (for output decoration) use this registry. No hardcoded emoji strings anywhere else.

### BR-EM-03: Text Commands Always Work
Every command that has an emoji shortcut MUST continue to work with its text name. Emoji are additive, never a replacement. `shikki doctor` and `shikki 🥕` are identical.

### BR-EM-04: Emoji with Arguments
Some emoji commands accept arguments. The router extracts the emoji from argv[1], maps it to the text command, and passes argv[2...] as arguments to the resolved command.

```
shikki 🧠 "design a caching layer"
→ shikki brain "design a caching layer"

shikki 🤔 abc123-def456
→ shikki explain abc123-def456
```

### BR-EM-05: Clock Emoji Normalization
All Unicode clock face emoji (🕐 through 🕛, plus ⏰ ⏱️ ⏲️) map to `schedule`. The router normalizes any clock-like emoji to the same command.

### BR-EM-06: Validation and Invalidation Signals
✅ and ❌ are quality signals stored in ShikiDB. When invoked with a UUID, they update the `quality_signals` table for that entity. When invoked with free text, they create a new signal entry. These feed the learning loop and confidence scoring.

```sql
INSERT INTO quality_signals (entity_id, signal_type, context, created_at)
VALUES ($1, 'validated', $2, NOW());
```

### BR-EM-07: Like/Dislike Signals
👍 and 👎 are lightweight feedback signals (distinct from validation). They record user sentiment without the formal quality gate semantics. Stored in the same `quality_signals` table with `signal_type = 'liked' | 'disliked'`.

### BR-EM-08: Bidirectional Rendering
Commands that produce headers or titles should include their emoji. `shikki status` renders `🌡️ Status`. `shikki doctor` renders `🥕 Diagnostics`. The renderer looks up the emoji from `EmojiRegistry` by command name.

### BR-EM-09: Help Output
`shikki help` (or `shikki 📃`) shows a two-column table: emoji on the left, text command + description on the right. Grouped by category (diagnostics, workflow, signals, navigation).

### BR-EM-10: Splash Screen Integration
The Shikki splash/welcome screen shows the user's top 5 most-used emoji commands. New users see the starter kit: 🥕 🌡️ 📊 🚀 📃. Usage frequency is tracked per-user in ShikiDB.

### BR-EM-11: Typo Tolerance for Emoji
If a user types an unrecognized emoji, the `TypoCorrector` checks if it's visually similar to a registered emoji (e.g., same Unicode category). If close, suggest the correct one. If no match, fall through to standard text typo correction.

### BR-EM-12: Multi-Byte Safety
Emoji are multi-byte Unicode. The router must compare using `String` equality (not byte-level), handle variation selectors (VS16 / `\uFE0F`), and handle ZWJ sequences (🧙‍♂️ is `🧙 + ZWJ + ♂️`). Normalize both the input and registry keys using `.precomposedStringWithCanonicalMapping` before comparison.

### BR-EM-13: Terminal Compatibility
Some terminals render emoji as double-width, some as single. The protocol does not attempt to fix terminal rendering — it works at the argument level. Emoji in output headers use the ANSI-aware padding already in StatusRenderer/ShipRenderer.

### BR-EM-14: Focus Mode
🔇 enters focus mode with explicit duration support:
- `shikki 🔇 20m` — focus for 20 minutes
- `shikki 🔇` (no duration) — show elapsed time since focus mode was enabled
- At timer expiry: popup "Want more? Y/N". Y extends by the same duration, N exits focus mode and suggests a ☕ break
- Focus mode suppresses ntfy notifications, queues inbox items instead of interrupting, and sets a tmux status indicator
- Manual toggle: `shikki 🔇` again exits focus mode early (same behavior as before)

### BR-EM-15: Undo via Checkpoint
⏪ triggers checkpoint-based undo. Without arguments, it shows the last 5 checkpoints. With a UUID, it restores that specific checkpoint. Delegates to `CheckpointManager.restore()`.

### BR-EM-16: Never Auto-Execute Destructive Emoji
Following BR-43 (never auto-correct to "stop"), the emoji router must NEVER auto-correct a mistyped emoji to a destructive command. Destructive commands: `stop`, `invalidate`, `undo`. If fuzzy match points to these, require exact match.

### BR-EM-17: Shell Alias Generation
`shikki doctor --emit-aliases` (or a dedicated setup command) can generate shell aliases for users who prefer typing `:carrot:` instead of pasting emoji. Optional convenience, not required for core protocol.

### BR-EM-18: Carrot/Rabbit Aliases
🥕, 🐰, 🐰🥕, and 🥕🐰 all map to `doctor`. The Bugs Bunny "What's up, doc?" reference is the soul of this command — the rabbit and carrot variants are easter eggs for users who know the joke. All four are registered in `EmojiRegistry` and treated as first-class aliases.

### BR-EM-19: Reaction System
Slack/iMessage-style reactions on tasks, agent outputs, and decisions. A reaction (using any signal emoji) can target a specific sub-task UUID:

```
shikki ✅ <task-uuid>   # validate a specific task
shikki 👍 <output-uuid> # like a specific agent output
```

Reactions are stored in `quality_signals` and feed the learning loop. Sub-task targeting means reactions are granular — reacting to a sub-task does not automatically react to its parent.

}
```

### EmojiRouter (ShikkiKit)

```swift
public enum EmojiRouter {
    /// Rewrite argv if the first argument (after binary name) is a registered emoji.
    /// Returns the original args if no emoji match.
    public static func rewrite(_ args: [String]) -> [String] {
        guard args.count >= 2 else { return args }

        let candidate = args[1]
            .precomposedStringWithCanonicalMapping
            .trimmingCharacters(in: .whitespaces)

        // Strip variation selector (VS16) for comparison
        let normalized = candidate.replacingOccurrences(of: "\u{FE0F}", with: "")

        // Try exact match first, then normalized
        let entry = EmojiRegistry.byEmoji[candidate]
            ?? EmojiRegistry.byEmoji[normalized]

        guard let entry else { return args }

        // Rewrite: [binary, emoji, ...rest] → [binary, command, ...rest]
        var rewritten = args
        rewritten[1] = entry.command
        return rewritten
    }
}
```

### Integration Point (ShikkiCommand.swift)

```swift
// In ShikkiCommand.main(), first line:
static func main() async {
    // BR-EM-01: Emoji pre-parser
    let args = EmojiRouter.rewrite(CommandLine.arguments)
    // ... use rewritten args for parsing
}
```

### Signal Storage Schema (ShikiDB)

```sql
-- quality_signals table (extends existing schema)
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS quality_signals (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    entity_id TEXT,           -- UUID of the target entity, or NULL for free-text
    signal_type TEXT NOT NULL, -- 'validated' | 'invalidated' | 'liked' | 'disliked'
    context TEXT,             -- free text / prompt that accompanied the signal
    source TEXT DEFAULT 'cli', -- 'cli' | 'tui' | 'push' | 'ios'
    created_by TEXT DEFAULT 'daimyo',
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_quality_signals_entity ON quality_signals(entity_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_quality_signals_type ON quality_signals(signal_type);
```

## Phase 6: Test Plan

### Unit Tests (EmojiRouterTests.swift)

| # | Test | Validates |
|---|------|-----------|
| 1 | `testRewriteKnownEmoji` — 🥕 → doctor | BR-EM-01 basic routing |
| 2 | `testRewriteEmojiWithArgs` — 🧠 "prompt" → brain "prompt" | BR-EM-04 arg passthrough |
| 3 | `testRewriteUnknownEmoji` — 🦄 → unchanged | BR-EM-01 no-match passthrough |
